1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,673
Welcome back, friends.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,176
Why can’t you just leave me alone?

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,179
Bean, running from your mother
is so last year.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,264
Elfo’s more of a mother to me
than you.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,475
This ruins so many fantasies,

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,268
but opens up so many new ones.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,564
Announcing the return
of Princess Tiabeanie.

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,776
Warning. She appears to be
in a bit of a mood.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,735
Ow!

10
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,573
There are people inside this castle
who want me dead.

11
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,367
She is clearly a threat.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,244
Elfo and Luci are all I have

13
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,288
and that is not a deep bench.
We gotta get out of here.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,045
Damn it!

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,215
Woah, Steamland.

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,054
There’s a power in Dreamland
beyond anything we have here.

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,933
I’m offering an alliance
between magic and science.

18
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,812
This is big. I really need
some time to drink about this.

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,314
-You mean--
-I know what I said.

20
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,449
This is the sinister plot
that just keeps giving.

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,953
So much gasping.

22
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,124
Our queen.

23
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,001
I know you can do this.

24
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,046
Badass Bean is the Bean
I wanna see right now.

25
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,008
You’re right. I am badass!

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,304
What is this?
Oh, my God. Calm down.

27
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,890
Oh, no, this is your life now.
It’s forever!

28
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,448
All right. I’ll talk to you later.
